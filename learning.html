        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence in Education?</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence in education is the utilization of AI tools in classrooms both by students and educators. The intention behind this is to enable both students and educators to streamline their workflows and learn better as a result. AI can address many of the problems that students and educators face today. It has the potential to act as a private tutor and also enable educators to constantly improve their teaching methodologies.
        <p>
        
        <h2>Advantages of AI in Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Personalized Learning
                <div class="expand">AI has the capability to adapt to each individual student's needs to better match their learning  style. Moreover, it can also be used by educators to personalize lectures.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Student Engagement
                <div class="expand">A direct side effect of the personalized learning experience. With more personalized and adaptable teaching methods, students will be able to engage more with coursework as the material will be clearer to them.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Accessible Learning
                <div class="expand">AI tools are extremely adaptable and are now becoming widely available with services such as ChatGPT becoming mainstream and widespread. The adaptability of AI tools allows them to overcome hurdles that plague the classroom such as langauge barriers. Communication is one of the most important aspects of learning, and with the real time translation abilities of AI it can enables educators to communicate with students who many not speak the same language.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced Accessibility
                <div class="expand">AI-powered tools provide real-time translation and accommodations for students with disabilities, making education more inclusive and accessible to diverse student populations.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Disadvantages of AI in Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Biases
                <div class="expand"> Since AI is trained on particular datasets, it can develop biases due to certain skews or deviations within the dataset itself. It is possible that this will provide biased education and even possibly false information.<div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Hallucinations
                <div class="expand">Since AI is trained on datasets and essentially just strings together already existing information to present facts, it is possible that it can generate false information in times of uncertainty. Essentially, when an AI does not know how to exactly answer a question, it can "hallucinate" false data and present it as if it were a fact.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Cheating Potential
                <div class="expand">Cheating is one of the largest and most pervasive concerns associated with AI. Students can utilize AI to essentially do their work for them, and often times this is difficult to reliably detect. While AI detecting tools do exist, they are currently unreliable and often generate many false positives. Cheating concerns will have to be addressed by educators before AI can see widespread adoption in classrooms.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of Human Interaction
                <div class="expand">One of the most important aspects of education is face to face education with a teacher or with peers. By implementing the use of AI in classrooms, educators run the risk of creating an over-reliance on AI tools, which can greatly diminish a students learning and social skills.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Successful Implementation of AI in Education</h2>
        <p>To successfully implement AI in education, institutions need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set clear goals and measurable objectives aligned with the institution's mission</li>
            <li>Invest in teacher training and professional development</li>
            <li>Ensure proper technological infrastructure and flexible AI platforms</li>
            <li>Regularly evaluate and gather feedback from students and teachers</li>
            <li>Address ethical considerations and ensure AI systems are free from bias</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of AI in Education</h2>
        <p>The future of AI in education is promising, with potential developments including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More sophisticated personalized learning systems</li>
            <li>Advanced automated grading and administrative tools</li>
            <li>Enhanced student engagement through interactive content</li>
            <li>Improved accessibility and inclusion through assistive technologies</li>
            <li>Better support for teachers through AI-powered professional development tools</li>
        </ul>
