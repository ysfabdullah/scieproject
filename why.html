        <h2>Understanding the Uses of AI in Education</h2>
        <p>
            AI in education has its cons, but it can still be very useful. Though AI in schools has mostly become synonymous with cheating and academic misconduct, it can still be a great tool when used correctly. AI can act as a sort of private tutor that is available to students whenever they may need it. Moreover, the adaptability of AI allows it to change its instructions based on individual student needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of acting as a private tutor, AI can also be used to automate tedious tasks such as analyzing large datasets or finding mistakes in writing. This allows it to be used by both students and educators to reduce an already stressful workload.
